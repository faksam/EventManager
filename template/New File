My expectations of the Andela Bootcamp
The Andela Bootcamp is a two-week, simulated development sprint led by senior Andela developers. The two weeks comprise of one week of home-based self-learning and one week of product development on-site at the Andela Epic Tower.
During this time we are expected to learn independently as well as on a team to deliver a final project. 

The Bootcamp follows a curriculum containing 17 learning outcomes/skills as follows:
Version Control, Agile Methodology, Programming Logic, Object-Oriented Programming, Test-Driven Development, Databases, HTTP and Web Services, Front-End Development, Growth Mindset, Relationship Building, Asks Questions, Adaptability, Seeks Feedback, Speaking to be understood, Writing Professionally, Git

At Andela, the selection process is aimed at identifying aspiring Andelans that portray The Andela EPIC Values: Excellence, Passion, Integrity & Collaboration.

My expection of the Andela Bootcamp is to acquire all the skills and learning outcomes that would set me on the path to being The EPIC World Class Developer I want to be. 
EPIC - an Excellent software developer, Passionate about software development, with undoubted Integrity, and always ready to Collaborate.

I believe the Andela Bootcamp is a learning path that would help me as an aspiring Andelan, to fit into the Andela Community and also get me started on the path to being a good Software Developer.

Three interesting colleagues I have met this Bootcamp
I have met a lot of awesome and interesting friends. I recognized Seun Faluyi the very first day, he had been responding to questions on slack, also Okeoghene Vese and David Essien, also I met Faith Adekunle a week earlier when I came for interview, I also met Molokwu Chidera who had just arrived to lagos from delta state for the bootcamp, Taiwo Kolawole was among the Bootcampers I met last year, Gabriel Micah, Chika Onuchukwu, Habib Audu, Okeoghene Vese, Micah Akpan, Anu Apiti, Taiwo Sunday, Maureen Oki, Jessica Madufor and lots of wonderful people.

The three interesting people I would be writing about are Okeoghene Vese, Molokwu Chidera and Gabriel Micah.

Okeoghene Vese,, Okeoghene is not in my group but he was one of the few friends I talked to the first five minutes I got into the EPIC Tower, I call him O.K because I could not pronounce his name correctly. Okeoghene is a Mathematician that loves programming, he didn’t know you could be paid to write codes, he thought it is a group sport and this December would make it his third year programming.

Molokwu Chidera is a gentle man, he studied Computer Information Systems and loves solving problems and he is an awesome team member, he believes at Andela he would be a World Class Developer solving problems with his programming skills. 

Gabriel Micah has been an awesome team member and a simple friend we have both helped eachother, sharing our knowledge together, he is from Imo state, he studied Communication Technology, and like myself he loves everything about Andela and the work environment.

I look forward to meeting others, to share and relate but individually and has a team.

My Experience In Bootcamp So Far

The Andela Bootcamp is divided into four parts spread over a period of two weeks, it is an important experience for aspiring Andelans. 

My experience so far in a word, Awesome. A lot has changed and the selection process is tougher than last year. 

Last year October I was at bootcamp and I would say it was not a playground. I remember thinking I had really good understanding of programming but each challenge during the bootcamp proved I did not know enough. 

The Andela Bootcamp now includes a pre-bootcamp week, this is the week right before the bootcamp. I was on a 22-hour journey from Jigawa to Lagos (by road) when I got the the pre-bootcamp project instructions, I could not start anything till about Wednesday. I was not prepared for the pre-bootcamp week. 

Keeping up with the pace of the daily challenge for the bootcamp and the main Bootcamp Project gives me so much joy because I have always wanted to be busy working/programming on my laptop. The past 24-hours I have forgotten to cook and I did not feel hungry like I would when I am not doing anything software related.

I met most of my friends from the previous bootcamp, they are now Rock-Star Developers at Andela and I am so excited I am getting another opportunity to be an Andelan, to also be among the Rock-Star Developers at Andela.

I am going to do my utmost best to make it past the Bootcamp and be an Andelan this year.
